# SPACEX-DATA-SCIENCE

This is my solution for the final project of the Data science IBM certification

This project has gone thorugh 4 phases:
# 1- Data collecting:
  -In this phase, i made a get request to the SPACEX API and then stored the response.json as our data frame. After that i did some data cleaning, dealing with missing values and filtering
